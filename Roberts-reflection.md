##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with git merge and working through merge conflictions prior to the GPS
##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  By going through an example of a merge conflict, I felt my troubles with merges were clarified
##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked about the syntax of git merge. I wasn't sure when you specified the two branches, which one merged into the other
##What still confuses you about git?
Most of the commands are becoming second nature, but if I ever perform a merge, I will take my time in order to get it right.
##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
 Both my guide and my partner were fully engaged. The GPS guide was fully attentive and chimed in if we were reaching a struggling point. My partner was fully engaged, regardless of whether he was navigating or driving. I thought the GPS was a positive experience since it allowed a pair to work, while still being able to ask an outsider questions and not getting stuck.

* What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  * I was struggling with the concept of fetching and merging a branch. I had never encountered these before, and it wasn't until now that I learned that these are simply steps 1 and 2 of git pull.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  * Git workflow was something that I had heard many times, but had never really understood. It helped to be actually collaborating with another person through gitHub. I also never knew exactly how collaboaring with another person in gitHub worked until now.
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  * I asked about some commands in git that I was unsure of, and learned those as well as some new shortcuts I hadn't previously known, such as git add . I also asked some questions on how to best navigate gitHub.
* What still confuses you about git?
  * Git is a fairly simple system to use, but one thing that always trips me up is the way that branches do not cross over into other directories. For example, I could checkout a new branch in one directory, but if I navigate into a directory within it, I'll still be on the master branch. This can really confuse you if you don't realize which directory you're in when you start.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  * I honestly enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. My partner was very easy to talk to and collaborate with, and the presence of the instructor was not at all intimidating. In fact, it was nice to be able to ask questions when we needed to.
